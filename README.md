# Weather Dashboard 
## Vladimir Berka's Homework #6

## Assignment Description
This is a CSS/HTML/Javascript homework assignment for the UW Bootcamp. The goal of the assignment is to create a single web page application that is able to fetch data from a Weather API. 

A visual mockup is provided by the instructor to demonstrate desired application functionality, appearance, and criteria.

The original user story, acceptance criteria, and mockup for the assignment is copied to the end of this document.

## Assignment Scope
Create a single web application that allows a user to input any city and search for the current weather of that city using JQuery and the Bootstrap front end framework. Future weather data and localStorage of the search history should be considered. 

No HTML, CSS, or Javascript starting code has been provided.

## Generalized Tasks
- Use the Bootstrap framework and populate the DOM with: dates, search history / search buttons, and miscellaneous weather data - including icons
- Write a javascript file with multiple functions to handle API fetch operations (pull data, write data, save data, parse data - JSON)  
- Use `moment()` and add date information to the webpage
- Use `Buttons` and `listenerEvents` to add web app functionality and responsiveness
- Store search history in `localStorage`
